# text-adventure-game
Academic project (individual) for *"Data Science: Python"*, a curricular course attended throughout the fall semester of my second master's degree in *Business Analytics* at Hult International Business School. 
By creating my own text-based game, inspired by Jules Verne's novel *"Around the World in Eighty Days"*,  I had the opportunity to practice the following *Python essentials*:
- Strings and String Manipulation
- User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
- User Input and Input Handling
- Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
- Loops (for/while)
- Controlling for Errors
